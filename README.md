# Fairsquares
a decentralized version of Superbowl Squares

FAIRSQUARES 
The Dapp “Fairsquares” is a game that is aimed at minimizing the amount of trust needed in group betting games similar to “SuperBowl Squares.” In essence a decentralized version of the party betting game “SuperBowl Squares.”

Each of the 100 squares is an available wagering space, labeled 0-9 on both sides. The price of each square is determined by the game’s host, but is usually pretty low since this is usually a friendly contest.
Once all the squares are sold, the boxes are assigned at random to give the bet some parity.


FAIRSQUARES STRATEGY
if the squares game you enter assigns squares randomly, there isn’t much strategy beyond buying as many squares as you’re allowed and hoping or the best. 

WINNING AT FAIRSQUARES
How does a player win on football squares? Each of the numbers of each of the squares, 0-9, corresponds to the final number in the score of the home or the away team in the game.
Whether the wager refers to the home or away team is determined by its position on the board. One axis is the home score, the other axis is the away score. Only the final number in the score is used because it’s fairly common for a quarter of football to pass without a score.

FAIRSQUARES PRIZES
Traditionally, prizes are paid out at the end of each quarter, for a total of four prizes. The prizes are traditionally not paid evenly – often, the total prize pool is broken up into fifths, so that one share goes to the first, second, and third quarter winners, while the winner of the final score gets two shares, or two-fifths of the total prize.
Here, the differences is that the payouts of the game are made by Chainlink’d smartcontracts that are linked to the score of the game at every quarter and administer payouts in a trust-less decentralized manner.
Also, the smart contract writer can charge a fee the participants of this DApp
